MicroMouse code for Control of Mobile Robots at USF

Our goal for the implementation:
  1) Explore the maze with a goal-seeking algorithm
  2) After finding the goal square in explore, visit all unvisited cells (unless deemed unnecessary)
  3) Return to (0,0)
  4) Drive to (4,4) using the shortest path.
