MicroMouse code for Control of Mobile Robots at USF

Our task was to write code for a robot with three proximity sensors and two stepper motors running on an HC9S12 microcontroller.

Our goal for the implementation:
  1. Explore the maze with a goal-seeking algorithm
  2. After finding the goal square in explore, visit all unvisited cells (unless deemed unnecessary)
  3. Return to (0,0)
  4. Drive to (4,4) using the shortest path.
